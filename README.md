## AI Powered Digital Radio

This project is implemented using Flutter framework and Alan AI platform. VelocityX framework is used to design the user interfaces. Serveral live streaming radio APIs have been used as radio channels.  

User can control the radio player with casual voice command. Such as,  

> - What does this app do?
> - Play some music
> - Play next channel
> - Play previous channel
> - Play some classic music
> - Play 98.2 FM
> - Stop the music

Not only that, this app also responds to casual converstions using the SmallTalk AI script intergrated into it.

#### Here are some snapshots of the running application
